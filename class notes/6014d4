  opening a socket needs transport host service


headers added to front of data
  first add port numbrer TCP header
    to the left is IP header


  if multiple apps talking to the socket and os



  22 - well known port to contact a server
  ports 1 through 1024 are usually privileged -

  ephemeral port is usually picked by the OS

  src port 1234

UDP vs TCP sockets

  UDP is connectionalles so only a local port number - no fixed destination messages go to
    send a packet out as a result
  TCP reliable connection, keeps thing in order

UDP client
5678 port number , bigger than 1024
byte[] buffer = new byte[512]
UDP socket in java - DatagramPacket pkt = new DatagramPacket(buffer, buffer.length);
tell it a buffer

HW2
remap all the numbers for little endian
high byte and low byte
put into short
0-15
take first 2 bytes decode as a number
first byte is high byte of id second is low byte of id

recursion desired, ask other servers
dig is saying RD is 1

AD
first 12 bytes are the header, 6 rows

next is the question

3 starts the question here
3 is the length byte
referring length and then the bytes

use wireshark to look at whole packet
shows it in finer pieces with highlighting it

ByteBuffer - used to decode numbers like big endian short
