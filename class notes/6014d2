timing issues
packets traveling between computers

packet has to get from one end to the other
speed of light
distance over links
network devices translation of signals to bytes
dispatching time at each router

4 types of delay
PROPAGATION DELAY: how long it takes to go over the wires, fiber optics, or through the air
TRANSMISSION DELAY: delay between bytes in machine and turning it into electrical signals over ethernet, at machine sending it out
PROCESSING DELAY:
QUEUEING DELAY: routers have multiple out and going packets, can cause a bottle neck, get a packet in and get it all in before can do something with it
  , router puts it in a queue

PROPAGATION DELAY:
  time to travel along medium
    depends on physics ,
    distance travelled
    speed of link- some fraction of the speed of light

TRANSMISSION DELAY:
  taking bytes, turning into medium format, light, electricity etc.
  depends on device and data

  device rate

PROCESSING DELAY:
  cpu of device looking at packet bytes deciding what to do with it
  time to inspect bytes and choose next step
  typically a few nanoseconds
  router manufacture use good techniques

QUEUING DELAY:
  queue fills when incoming rate exceeds outgoing rate
  sustained traffic intensity = packets get dropped

time packets bytes are held in a queue, depends on traffic
incoming data rate = average packet size x incoming packet rate
  traffic intensity = incoming data rate /R

what can we measure
sending packets from one to another

round trip time (rtt)
need protocol that will bounce data back
ICMP - internet control message protocol
message sent is called a ping, server response is pong
run as ping command

can we get info about a route?
TTL is "time to live"
how many times to keep sending packet
how many places to try

traceroute uses this trick systematically in terminal
  takes advantage that thin layer between tcp and ip
  rely on pings being served quickly from all machines on the way

latency vs throughput
  latency : how long you have to wait for one small thing
    in time ,seconds , RTT can help understand latency
  throughput: how much you can send through , how long you have to wait for everything
    mailing a box of flash drives can have very high throughput, but also high latency

HW:
work through calculations, and given metrics
some programming to graph the data, script language to get output
