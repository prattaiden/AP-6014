tcp timeout
  based on estimate of round trip time

flow control relies on rwnd and window<=rwnd

congestion control uses cwnd and window<=cwnd

SEGMENT part of package that is tcp header in the payload
max segment size from tcp is max packet size minus ip header size
  packet size in most devices 1500 bytes


Additive increase, multiplicative decrease (AIMD)
  sawtooth pattern

do with pointer name
when recieve packet dns request
array of bytes
use two high bits to point to address somewehre else

routing
ip layer
IPv4 address is 32 bits
  4 giga bytes
  155.98.0.0/16 IP prefix - insterad of writing 0 at end, 16 for number of bits for prefix

IPv6 128 bits

subnet
  network small enough that every host sees every other

DHCP
  takes advantage of broadcast to configure a host

routing
bit ip packets


1/29/24
IPv4 packet format
ipv4 packet 32 bits wide

NAT network address translation
change address and port number
10. number local address

docker - create new machine or host
  machine is fake running in regular os


1/31/24
layers
application - firefox, ping
transport - tcp, udp
network - ip
link - wifi
physical - electrons

control plane, how rules rules get installed

forwarding table

finding routes
dijktras algorithm

dx(y) is the shortest distance from x to y
c(v,y) reports the distance from v to immediately connected y

  dx(y) = minb {dx(v)+c(v,y)}

define distance for y - take one step, define distance in that step

Bellman-Form equation

Time Complexity
Dijkstra's - link state - global algorithm
  for each of N nodes
    visit each of N-1 other nodes
      where picking each other node takes O(log N) time
        O(N^2 log N)
Bellmain-ford - distance vector
  for each of N nodes
    check tables of up to M adjacent nodes
      where each table has N entries
        and iterate up to N times
        O(M N^3)
  asynchronous
